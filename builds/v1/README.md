# DOC: Dual Orchestrator Core

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Released

DOC (`doc`) is a local-first, CLI-based **Agentic Pair-Programming Environment**. It orchestrates two expert AI agents—**Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex**—to work as Peer Engineers in a "Twin-Turbo" workflow on **any local repository**.

## Core Workflow: "Assign & Audit"

1.  **Point**: Launch DOC and assign it to a target repository/folder.
2.  **Plan**: Agents analyze the codebase map (`repo_map.txt`) and `git` history.
3.  **Execute**: Agents run in parallel subprocesses to code, test, and review.
4.  **Audit**: You watch the "Huddle" (chat) and "Logs" in real-time via the TUI.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `claude` and `codex` CLIs installed and authenticated (or use Simulation Mode).

### Install via pip
```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

Run the orchestrator from anywhere:

```bash
doc
```

1. **Enter Project Path**: When prompted, paste the full path to the repo you want DOC to work on.
2. **Assign a Mission**: Type your task (e.g., "Refactor the Auth logic" or "Fix the bug in main.py").
3. **Monitor**: The TUI shows the Agents (`NAVIGATOR` and `DRIVER`) discussing and executing the task.

### Commands
- `/status`: View active project path, agent mode (Sim/Real), and configured binaries.
- `/mode`: Toggle between **Simulation Mode** (Safety) and **Real Agents** (Execution).
- `/map`: View the repository map generated by the Cartographer.
- `/clear`: Wipe the memory and reset state.
- `/help`: Show help menu.

## Configuration

DOC uses environment variables (or a `.env` file) to control behavior.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DOC_ENABLE_REAL_AGENTS` | Set to `true` to execute real CLI commands. | `false` |
| `DOC_CLAUDE_BIN` | Command to launch Claude agent. | `claude` |
| `DOC_CODEX_BIN` | Command to launch Codex agent. | `codex` |
